# Biophysical-blood-flow-model

The Python script for the biophysical simulations described in the manuscript "Effect of simultaneous multislice imaging (SMS) and repetition time on biexponential liver intravoxel incoherent motion" are published here.

The simulation models the flow of blood magnetization in liver tissue according to a laminar isotropic pipe flow velocity distribution while considering magnetic resonance excitation pulses and T1 relaxation at given slice and gap positions.

For more detail please refer to the manuscript.
